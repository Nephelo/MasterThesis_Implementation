/**
  <p>
  A generic sort class for arrays whose elements are derived
  from Object.  Sadly, this does not include types like integer
  and double.
  </p>

  <p>
  This is an abstract class.  The class that extends this class must
  define the <i>compare</i> function.  The <i>compare</i> function returns an
  integer value that is less than, equal or greater than zero
  depending on the result of the comparision (the function is modeled
  after UNIX strcmp).
  </p>

  <p>
  This class is based on the Java quicksort algorithm by
  James Gosling at at Sun Microsystems (see below).
