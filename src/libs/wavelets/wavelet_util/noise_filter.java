  The objective in filtering is to remove noise while keeping the
  features that are interesting.
  </p>

  <p> 
  Wavelets allow a time series to be examined at various
  resolutions.  This can be a powerful tool in filtering out noise.
  This class supports the subtraction of gaussian noise from
  the time series.
  </p>

  <p>
  The identification of noise is complex and I have not found any
  material that I could understand which discussed noise
  identification in the context of wavelets.  I did find some material
  that has been difficult and frustrating.  In particular
  <i>Image Processing and Data Analysis: the multiscale approach</i>
  by Starck, Murtagh and Bijaoui.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  If the price of a stock follows a random walk, its price will be
  distributed in a bell (gaussian) curve.  This is one way of stating
  the concept from financial theory that the daily return is normally
  distributed (here daily return is defined as the difference between
  yesterdays close price and today's close price).  Movement outside
  the bounds of the curve may represent something other than a random walk
  and so, in theory, might be interesting.
  </p>

  <p> 
  At least in the case of the single test case used in developing this
  code (Applied Materials, symbol: AMAT), the coefficient distribution
  in the highest frequency is almost a perfect normal curve.  That is,
  the mean is close to zero and the standard deviation is close to
  one.  The area under this curve is very close to one.  This
  resolution approximates the daily return.  At lower frequencies the
  mean moves away from zero and the standard deviation increases.
  This results is a flattened curve, whose area in the coefficient
  range is increasingly less than one.
  </p>

  <p> 
  The code in this class subtracts the normal curve from the
  coefficients at each frequency up to some minimum.  This leaves only
  the coefficients above the curve which are used to regenerate the
  time series (without the noise, in theory).  This filter removes 50
  to 60 percent of the coefficients.
  </p>

  <p>
  Its probably worth mentioning that there are other kinds of
  noise, most notably Poisson noise.  In theory daily data
  tends to show gaussian noise, while intraday data would
  should Poisson noise.  Intraday Poisson noise would result
  from the random arrival and size of orders.
