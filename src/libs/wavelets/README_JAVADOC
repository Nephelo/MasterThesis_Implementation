  To generate the javadoc documentation for the test files
and packages in this directory:

  1. Create the local directory "doc"
 
  2. Use the javadoc command below

javadoc -private -d doc -classpath ".;e:\jdk1.2.2\jre\lib\rt.jar" *.java dataInput double_vec experimental sort wavelet_util wavelets

  Obviously this is for Windows.  Change the directory paths as needed
for UNIX or Linux.
